I don't remember how I stumbled onto Clown Core, but I do remember how it made me feel.

Watch this, and see how you feel.

When you get past all of the... unsettling feelings... all that is left is insane, raw talent and one of the coolest songs you've ever heard.

I went down the Google rabbit hole, trying to work out who the band was. At that time, there was no Wikipedia article, and there wasn't much on who they were or why there was clowns.

At some point I added a few Clown Core songs to some playlists in Spotify, and this _Louis Cole_ guy started popping up in my recommendations.

I eventually came across this song and was like yep, these guys are is absolutely, 100%, Clown Core.

Didn't take me too long to then stumble into KNOWER, and this track, which might be a top 5 of all time song for me. This song is just the coolest song ever. Every person in the clip is the coolest, most talented person I've ever seen.
